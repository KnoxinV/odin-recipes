        <p><li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li></p>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="list"><p>For the Salmon</p></h3>
    <ul class="content">
        <p><li>2 skin-on salmon filets</li></p>
        <p><li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li></p>
        <p><li>1 tablespoon flour</li></p>
        <p><li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li></p>
        <p><li>1 tablespoon butter</li></p>
        <p>1-2 tablespoons of sake</p>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="list instructions">Instructions</h2>  
    <ol class="content">
        <p><li>Combine sake, mirin, soy sauce, and brown sugar. mix well to 
            dissolve the sugar and setr aside for later.</li></p>
        <p><li>Rinse and pat dry the salmon. Season the meat with salt and
            pepper before sprinkling with the flour and coating evenly.
            Doing this helps retain its <em>umami</em> flavor and juiciness.</li></p>
        <p><li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add
            1/2 Tbsp neutral oil and 1 Tbsp unsalted butter. Take care not to
            burn the butter. If the frying pan gets too hot, reduce the heat
            or remove it from the heat temporarily. Then, sear the skin of
            the salmon fillets: One at a time, press the skin against the hot
            frying pan's surface for 15 seconds before laying it skin side
            (or presentation side) down in the pan. Repeat with the remaining
            salmon. <b></b>Tip:</b> The presentation side (skin side) should
            go down into the pan first because you will get the best browning
            on the first side that hits the clean pan.</li></p>
        <p><li>Cook the salmon for 3 minutes, or until the bottom is golden
            brown, and then flip.</li></p>
        <p><li>To the pan, add 1-2 Tbsp sake—1 Tbsp for thin fillets and no
            more than 2 Tbsp for thicker fillets. Cover the pan with a lid
            and reduce the stove's heat to low. Steam the salmon for about
            3-5 minutes, depending on the fillet thickness. If the sake has
            evaporated but the salmon isn't cooked through yet, add another
            tablespoon of sake and continue steaming.</li></p>
        <p><li>Cook the salmon until it registers an internal temperature of
            125-130°F at the thickest part of the fillet, then transfer the
            salmon to a tray or plate. Cooking time can vary between 4-8
            minutes, depending on thickness.</li></p>
        <p><li>Add the teriyaki sauce ingredients to the pan and increase the
            heat a bit. When the sauce starts to boil, add the salmon back to
            the pan. Begin to spoon the sauce over the sallmon until the sauce
            starts to thicken. </li></p>
        <p><li>Transfer the salmon to a plate and drizzle the sauce on top.</li></p>
    </ol>
