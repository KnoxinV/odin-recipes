    <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>This is a creamy, rich soup that is popular in Mexico City. In the warmer
        months it is typically served chilled, but works great as a hot soup
        for those cold winter nights.</p>

        <p><li>4 tablespoons butter</li></p>

        <p><li>1 medium russet potato, peeled and roughly chopped</li></p>

    <ol class="content">
        <p><li>Heat butter in a 4-qt. saucepan over medium heat.Add leeks,
            onions, and potato, and cook, stirring often, until soft, about
            20 minutes.</li></p>    
        <p><li>Add the stock and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
            potato is very tender, about 35 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Use an immersion blender and pur√©e until smooth. Season with
            salt and pepper to taste. <i>(see note)</i></li></p>
        <p><li>To serve, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and a 
            spoonful of crema, or sour cream.</li></p>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="note">Note</h2>   
        <div>The immersion blender makes this so much easier to be able to do
        it all in one pot, but you <strong>CAN</strong> do this with a
        blender if you dont have one. Just be sure it's safe to use with
        hot liquids.</div>
