    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's a shephard's pie with chicken instead of lamb. <strong>BUT</strong> what
        if we took the <em>format</em> of shepherd's pie and applied it to, say...,
        chicken pot pie! It's a great mash-up, and swapping out the pie crust for
        mashed potatoes is an easy, 0-complaints way of getting around making your
        own crust.</p>

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>   
        <li>1/2 small yellow onion, finely diced</li>   
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>    
        <li>1/2 teaspoon EACH: onion powder mustard powder, tyme, rosemary</li>
        <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup half & half</li>
        <li>1 chicken bouillon cube</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen vegetables</li>   
        <li>5 cups warm mashed potatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees</li></p>
        <p><li>Pat the chicken dry and season with salt/pepper. Add 3 cups
            of chicken broth to a medium saucepan and add the chicken. 
            Gradually bring it to a gentle boil. Let the chicken cook with
            the lid cracked for 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Don't
            boil rapidly or the chicken will be tough. Remove the chicken
            and use forks to shred. Set aside and reserve the broth that the
            chicken cooked in.</li></p>
        <p><li>While the chicken cooks, melt 4 Tbsp. butter in a wide
            (12-inch) pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté
            them for 4 minutes. Add the garlic and seasonings. Toss to
            coat and cook for 1 more minute.</li></p>
        <p><li>Add the flour and toss to coat. Cook for 2 minutes or until
            you can no longer smell raw flour.</li></p>
        <p><li>Reduce heat to low. Add 2 cups of the reserved chicken broth
            in small splashes, stirring to incorporate. Add the half and
            half in the same manner. Adding the liquid too quickly will
            break the roux and interfere with the thickness of the gravy.</li></p>
        <p><li>Add chicken bouillon and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce.
            Then add the shredded chicken and stir to combine.</li></p>
        <p><li>Increase heat to medium and continue to add splashes of the
            remaining 1 cup of chicken broth while letting the filling simmer,
            reduce, and concentrate for 10-15 minutes. I usually use ¾ of
            the remaining cup.</li></p>    
        <p><li>Add the frozen vegetables and stir to combine and heat through.
            Remove from heat.</li>
        <p><li>Transfer filling to a lightly greased 9 x13-inch baking dish
            if your skillet isn't oven/broil safe.</li></p>
        <p><li>Let the filling cool slightly, then carefully place scoops
            of warm potatoes on the top. Try to add several scoops that are
            all almost touching each other to eliminate the amount of
            spreading you'll need to do.</li></p>
        <p><li>Use a silicone spatula to gently spread the warm potatoes
            in an even and smooth layer over the filling. Don't push down
            hard to ensure the potatoes stay on the top. If desired, use
            a fork to “rake” a design on the top. Place in the preheated
            oven and bake uncovered for 10 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Set broiler to high (550 degrees), and let the top brown
            for about 4 minutes, watch it carefully during this time to
            ensure it doesn't burn. Don't do this with glass or Pyrex
            baking dishes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Remove and allow to sit 5 minutes before serving.</li></p>
    </ol>
